Endemic rhythmical patterns in language and energy exchange contain information about cultural worldviews. 
<br>
<br>
Speakers in this piece were captured at a heightened emotional state. By the manner in which such emotions are expressed and through the lens of language, regional attitudes are glimpsed. This is also comment on the prevalence of emotions and the shape they take by region.

<br>
<b>Language and then emotions.</b>
<br>
<br>
Language, and the information processing that communication is in the brain, take shapes that exist beyond anthropological forms, organised in natural patterns. Cognitive processes mirror archetypes in nature, bound to develop into language.
<br>
<br>
Matter, energy  and its processes, exchange in organic structures. There is no not being natural. 
<br>
<br>
Thoughts of linguistic structure, never necessarily verbalised. 
<br>
<br>
Mental pictures determining behaviour, social interaction. Extending into networked collective character.
<br>
<br>
Vast amounts of information reach the cortex, travel and feedback, form abstraction layers that scape normal awareness, and provide results for convoluted, dense data processing, through intuition and emotions. After all, not so dismissible.  
<br>
<br>
Whereas some state that creativity is not the final result of a deliberate and mechanical computation, it could also be the fed-back erratic product of an incessant drive to produce ideas and mental projections, re-assessed and iterated until a satisfying outcome is reached.
<br>
<br>
Inflexions of language, convey an emotional state, high rates of information about a state of mind, about a point in knowledge and a mental image. Communication is more than the expressed words, its is the expansive meaning branching from them. 
<br>
<br>
Collective brain bricklaying over millennia. Across nature. 
<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, dynamism in the nature of language exchange, information flow and communication will beget new shapes in oral tradition.

<b><h4>The trees are speaking.</h4></b>
<br>
<br>
An imaginary landscape in which technology forms representations of natural systems.
<br>
<br>
A synthetic landscape of events and sounds that reminisces of natural forms that could be.
<br>
<br>
Layered samples of voices draw a rhythmical, almost musical pattern, emphasising the emergence of shapes of language, mounted on organic relations of vibrations. 
<br>
<br>
A variety of interaction between signals, derive in the interdependency of factors on the evolution of processes in the generation of patterns.
<br>
<br>
This is not only the natural environment, but an artificial soundscape that starts by blending in with recorded and processed birds and ambience, morphing to complete abstractions of natural systems. 
<br>
<br>
The degradation of digital audio information resembles the optimisation of communication, erosion of sounds, of words that transform their shape and meaning over the abstracting passing of time. 
<br>
<br>
Textures of sound waves coincide with the communication and codification of messages over channels. Dynamics in the information exchange, and sounds arrangement, that could acquire meaning and turn into words. 
<br>
<br>
By mixing the easily cognizable input of chirps, the concept of nature serves as a vehicle to arrive at inductions of language in a synthetic order. 
<br>
<br>
There is intentional avoidance of the exhausted resource of short loops, challenging the messages that can be crafted, in a physical and spatial experience, contrasting with a purely compositional one. 
<br>
<br>
Nihilism of modern human conditions. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>But we have put our hands on it.</b>
<br>
<br>
Cvirkas would have liked to speak about language. 
<br>
<br>
We think of the origin of things, like voices and words.
<br>
<br>
The evolution of the interaction of sounds and the images they evoke start to dig into the thoughts of the nature and emergence of language.
<br>
<br>
But, documentation probably makes for a more static language, since a particular form is favoured and sanctioned in an organised, larger-than-life time frame. Self directed evolution.
